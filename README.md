# 👨🏻‍💻 Start The Node (Linux/Mac) 

</div>


* 1️⃣ Clone RL-SWARM Repo

```
git clone https://github.com/gensyn-ai/rl-swarm.git
```


* 2️⃣ Create a screen session **(vps)**

```
screen -S gensyn
````

* 3️⃣ Navigate to rl-swarm

```
cd rl-swarm
```

* 4️⃣ Create & Activate a Virtual Environment

```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

* 5️⃣ Install Left-over dependencies

```
cd modal-login
```

```
yarn install
```

```
yarn upgrade &&  yarn add next@latest &&  yarn add viem@latest
```

* 6️⃣ Run the swarm Node 🚀

```
cd ..
```

```
./run_rl_swarm.sh
```

- After Running the Above command it will promt `Would you like to connect to the Testnet? [Y/n]` Enter `Y`

- After than it will promt `>> Which swarm would you like to join (Math (A) or Math Hard (B))? [A/b]`  Enter   `a`

- After than it will promt `>> How many parameters (in billions)? [0.5, 1.5, 7, 32, 72]`    

👇See below and Choose the model Depends on Your System! 

<pre>
- Qwen 2.5 0.5B                - Recommended 4GB RAM, (1GB DOWNLOAD)
- Qwen 2.5 1.5B                - Recommended 8GB RAM, (4GB DOWNLOAD)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1fed4b08-4ec4-44de-868c-b2d314cd2a02)


- Now U can see A `ORG_ID` On ur Terminal..Save it!


* Now It will promt `Would you like to push models you train in the RL swarm to the Hugging Face Hub? [y/N]` Enter `N`
